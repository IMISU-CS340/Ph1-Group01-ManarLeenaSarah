    " This tutorial is an AI project that concerns with the needing of supporting materials regarding to the few resources for the computer students.as you see in the title we will use search! so, what is search in AI? is the process of explore something and retrieve  a solution if exists.\n",
    " \n",
    " we are focusing on Informed search technique, its main concepts and two of its popular algorithms. Search problems  is our main concern in this lesson. We formulate an analogy  to suit the search space.The following  image summarize  what you going to learn .\n",

    "  ### 1.1 Search technique\n",
    "   The search space in AI divided into two technique, 1-Uninformed(Blind)search,2-Informed(Heuristic) search.The following image represent the difference between the two technique.\n",

    " Heuristic is an estimated value from a specific state to the goal state,in our problem, the heuristic represent the time it take to send a message from any state to the goal state while the path(link)is congested.\n",

    "### 1.3 Incremental and Complete state formulation\n",

We need to take care of this issue. \n",
    "Our main idea is to simulate the work of Routing Algorithm which is(an algorithm that determine the best path to a message).\n",
    "The problem:\n",
    "device (S) wish to send an emergence message to device(G), there is no direct link between the two device. We need to determine the best path to make (G) receive the emergence message quickly.We will implement  two algoirthm to determine  the best path for the message.\n",

    "What is formulation? \"It is the process of determining the constituent parts of a problem: its important factors and variables, and the interrelationships between them\"[2], like initial state, goal state, actions and transaction model.We formulate the problem using incremental formulation. You will see these in the  following subsections.\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### 2.1.1 initial state\n",
    "  The first state of a problem, [S] is the initial state of the message.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  #### 2.1.2 actions \n",
    "  Go from current state to any of its adjacent state.for example state[S] can choose to go to [A,B,C] states.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  #### 2.1.3 transaction model\n",
    "   Or successor is a function that generates a next state from the current state.As we will see that each algorithm has different mechanism to choose the next state,A* choose the minimum congested state while Simulated Annealing choose a random state.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  #### 2.1.4 state space\n",
    "  We mean by state space every device on the network. for our example S,A,B,E,D,F,G.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  #### 2.1.5 goal state\n",
    "  Is the state we want to reach.in our example the message arrive to device [G]\n",
    " \n",
    " #### 2.1.6 the new representation\n",
    " <img src=\"img/complete.jpg\">\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " Each number on a link represents the time needed to arrive to state n. while each number inside a circle represents the heuristic value(in our problem heuristic main the time it take a message to arrive to the destination if the path is congested).\n",
    " \n",
    "  #### 2.1.6 problem implementation\n",
    "  After the formulation , we can implement the problem as a simple code.\n",
